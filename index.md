## Bio 
I am currently a first year PhD Candidate at University of Texas at Dallas. My research interest is in language development in neurodevelopmental populations. Previously, I was in a cognitive neuroscience lab as a research coordinator investigating how genetical and environmental influences affect cognitvie development in preteens. I also received my BA in psychology and did my undergrad thesis on the topic of how different language experience influence cogntive abilities.
